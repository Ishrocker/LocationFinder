This project was created as a learning experiance
and to explore PWA concepts.

It is very rough and the google maps api
was added just as something interesting to
populate with geolocation coorinates.
It will throw an error that it cannot be
shown properly because it isn't being paid for and
doesn't have an API key.  Feel free to add you own
api key to the import if you want to see this app
in all its glory.
